# PersonalProjects
This is a collection of projects I have completed. I hope this highlights a small portfolio of my design and programming work.
Included is a personal project: a pen. It is the 3 iteration of my pen design. This was designed to be manufactured using the
resources available in the Design and Manufacturing Lab at the University of Florida.
